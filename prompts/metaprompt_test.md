# Production-Ready Data Dashboard Web App - Requirements

**Goal:** Build a production-ready, senior-level data dashboard web app that is calm, clear, and fast. This is a tool interface, not a marketing page.

---

## Required Tech Stack (Opinionated)

Use this stack unless impossible:

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript (Leveraging the stable React Compiler)
- **AI Orchestration:** Vercel AI SDK (Essential for streaming LLM responses, tool calling, and handling UI states for AI)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4.0 (Using the high-performance Oxide engine and native container queries)
- **Component System:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI Primitives)
- **Data Layer:** TanStack Query v5 (Client-side sync) + Next.js `use cache` (Server-side caching)
- **Data Grid:** TanStack Table v8 (For complex logs, user lists, and analytics)
- **Validation & Forms:** Zod + React Hook Form (Unified validation for client inputs and Server Actions)
- **Database/ORM:** Drizzle ORM (Lighter and more "Edge-ready" than Prisma for 2025 serverless environments)
- **Authentication:** Clerk or Auth.js v5 (Clerk for rapid RBAC deployment; Auth.js for self-hosted control)
- **Security:** OWASP Top 10 (2025) + Rate Limiting (via Upstash/Redis for AI endpoints)

**Data Source:** We will integrate the datasource from Supabase

---

## App Architecture Requirements

Use a single source of truth for data (API/database). The UI reads from query cache, not random component state.

### Separate:
- **Server state** (TanStack Query)
- **UI state** (local component state)
- **Form state** (React Hook Form)

### Use Next.js App Router patterns for layout:
- `/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` with persistent sidebar
- Route-level loading/error boundaries
- Server components for initial data where appropriate, client components for interactivity

---

## Design Frameworks to Apply (Non-negotiable)

1. **Information Architecture (IA):** Organize by user goals/decisions, not by features
2. **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Reduce visual noise; make scanning effortless
3. **Progressive Disclosure:** Default view is simple; advanced controls appear only when needed
4. **Perceived Performance:** UI should feel instant via optimistic updates, skeletons, and non-blocking interactions

---

## UI/UX Specifications (Senior Bar)

### 1) Layout & Hierarchy
- Strict grid; consistent spacing scale
- Main content dominates; navigation is visually quiet
- No oversized logos/banners. This is a tool.

### 2) Color & Token System
- Neutral base + one accent used only for primary actions/highlights
- **System colors:**
  - `red` = error/destructive
  - `green` = success
- Contrast must be readable. Never use color as the only indicator.

### 3) Navigation
**Persistent left sidebar:**
- Grouped links
- Clear active state
- Settings/logout at bottom

**Top bar** only for global page actions + global search (optional)

### 4) Tables (Core Dashboard Utility)

Use TanStack Table features:
- Search + filters + sort
- Pagination (client or server)
- Row selection with bulk actions (selection reveals contextual toolbar)
- Column visibility + responsive columns

### 5) Charts (Keep them Functional)
- Only line and bar charts
- Always include axes, labels, values, gridlines
- Tooltips on hover

**Choose chart approach:**
- Use **Recharts** for simple "business dashboards"
- Use **ECharts** if dataset is large/high-frequency updates

*(Prefer functional clarity over fancy visuals.)*

### 6) Interaction Patterns (Radix-backed)
- **Popover** for small, non-blocking actions (display options, quick filters)
- **Dialog/Modal** for complex or blocking flows (create/edit item)
- **Toast notifications** for success/error/warning
- **Optimistic UI** for common mutations:
  - Immediate UI update, rollback on failure
  - Use TanStack Query optimistic updates or React's `useOptimistic` pattern

### 7) States & Trust (Must be designed)

For every data region/component, implement:
- **Loading** (skeletons)
- **Empty state** (clear CTA)
- **Error state** (recoverable, retry)
- **Success confirmation** (toasts)

*Users should never wonder "did that work?"*

---

## Data Layer Requirements (Be Explicit)

### Define:
- **Data entities** (e.g., Users, Projects, Links, Events, Metrics)
- **Which endpoints** power which cards/tables/charts
- **Refresh strategy:**
  - Polling vs websocket vs manual refresh
- **Caching rules:**
  - Stale time, refetch on focus, invalidation on mutation (TanStack Query)

---

## Security & "Responsible App" Defaults

- Enforce RBAC/permissions **server-side** (not just UI hiding)
- Validate all inputs with Zod on server
- Avoid exposing secrets to client
- Add basic audit logging hooks for key actions (create/update/delete)
- Follow OWASP Top 10 mindset: secure defaults, least privilege, safe error handling

---

## Deliverables (What you must output)

### A working Next.js dashboard app scaffold:
- Routes, layout, sidebar, top actions

### One "Dashboard Overview" page with:
- KPI cards
- A table with filtering/sorting/selection + bulk actions
- A line chart + bar chart

### A "Create/Edit" flow:
- Modal dialog form with validation + toast + optimistic update

### Fully implemented loading/empty/error states

### Clean, consistent component patterns and tokens

---

## Final Quality Gate

✅ Understandable in <10 seconds  
✅ Calm, professional, data-first  
✅ Accessible keyboard navigation (Radix primitives help here)  
✅ Fast-feeling interactions (optimistic updates + good loading UX)
